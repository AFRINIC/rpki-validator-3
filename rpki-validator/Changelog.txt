- Minimize memory consumption and disk requirement by dropping Hibernate/H2 database, 
  and use Xodus https://github.com/JetBrains/xodus as persistence instead.
- Prevent Out of Memory by refactoring multiple subsystems.
- Improve responsiveness, set default RPKI object clean up grace period to 48H (used to be 7 days).
