# This is the port for the API, health checks, and future UI

# This is the port for the (plain TCP) RPKI-RTR server
# Note that according to the RFCs this should be 323, but we would need to
# run the service as root to bind to that port. Most clients support that
# a different port is used.
#
# If you must use 323 here, then iptables port NAT may help
