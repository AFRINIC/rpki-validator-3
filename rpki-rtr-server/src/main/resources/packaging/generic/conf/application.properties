# This is the port for the API, health checks, and future UI
#
# Note that we do not recommend exposing this externally. If you must,
# then we recommend that an HTTPS proxy is used, and access is restricted.
# You can find an example config here:

server.port=8081

# By default the service binds to localhost only. You can enter a different IP address,
# or comment out the following key value pair to have the service bind to all addresses.
server.address=127.0.0.1

#
# This is the port for the (plain TCP) RPKI-RTR server
# Note that according to the RFCs this should be 323, but we would need to
# run the service as root to bind to that port. Most clients support that
# a different port is used.
#
# If you must use 323 here, then iptables port NAT may help
rtr.server.port=8323

#
# Point this variable to where your rpki-validator-3 is running.
rpki.validator.validated.objects.uri=http://localhost:8080/api/objects/validated

# Use the following settings to change JVM parameters
#
# Change the initial and maximum memory for the JVM
#
# Notes:
# - 128 MB should be enough to cache the validated objects
jvm.memory.initial=128m      # -Xms jvm option -> initial memory claimed by the jvm
jvm.memory.maximum=128m      # -Xmx jvm option -> maximum memory for the jvm
