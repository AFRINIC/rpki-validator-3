In addition, a ROA specifies the maximum prefix length that the AS is authorised to originate. Only the legitimate holder of the prefix can create a valid ROA.\nROAs are intended to be positive attestations, but the presence of a ROA for an ASN and prefix combination implies that announcements of this prefix from other origin ASNs, or for more specific prefixes, will be considered invalid.\nMore than one ROA may exist for the same prefix and as long as one of them matches the announcement it is considered valid. The announcement validation rules are defined in RFC 6483 and are explained in more detail in the Router section."
